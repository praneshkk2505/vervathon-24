Problem Statement Description:
         Imagine a world where your words can instantly shape reality. ShapeShift AI transforms text descriptions 
         into fully interactive, customized 3D models in real-time. This tool doesn’t just generate models; it creates dynamic,
         responsive 3D environments where objects evolve based on context, user preferences, and creativity. Perfect for everything 
         from virtual worlds to product prototyping, ShapeShift AI turns imagination into interactive assets, unlocking creative potential 
         for non-experts, developers, and innovators alike. It’s the ultimate fusion of language, art, and technology—redefining creation, one sentence at a time.
Technology used:
  Insert API of open AI in python code to create a app to generate 3D model from the text. 
Learning Things:
  We are learn about API key and explore more open ai sources for each field which gives a wider idea about the ai tools and its implementation.
